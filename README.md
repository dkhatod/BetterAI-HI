Why use Artificial Intelligence when you've got Human Intelligence by your side? I introduce to you HIbot, a far more scalable (potentially cheaper) alternative which can run even on a potato, provided a good connection. 

Warning: HIbot can have feelings, do NOT piss it off, it'll stop doing your work for you.

To run, please reach me at dkhatod@vt.edu as this might be a bit confusing to set up.
